# scc-cis-23
Repo containing code written for CIS 23: Data Structures and Algorithms at Solano College. 

To compile using the GNU g++ compiler, use
```bash
g++ #.h *.cpp -Wall -pedantic -std=c++11 -o out
```
The flag `-Wall` shows all warnings upon compilation, and the flag `-pedantic` conforms to ISO C++ standards. See [here](https://faculty.cs.niu.edu/~mcmahon/CS241/Notes/Unix_Reference/command_gcc.html) for documentation.
